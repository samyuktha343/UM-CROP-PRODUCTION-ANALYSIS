# UM-CROP-PRODUCTION-ANALYSIS
This project is done by me during my Data Analyst Internship at Unified Mentor

The original dataset is attached above as Crop Production data

About The Project:

I analyzed the dataset containing states and districts of India, Season, Year and Area to see if it had any impact on Crop Production in India.


I cleaned the data and removed the duplicates with the help of Power Query to maintain the integrity of data and used aggregation on data using Pivot Tables and bar and doughnut chart in Excel.Implemented the overall Crop Production analysis with the Dynamic Visualization using PowerBI


The result shows a strong association between Crop Production with Seasonal changes with the Year, Area used and respective staple food of each States in India.


Through this project I learned the more pivot table features and usage of the dynamic dashboards for interactive reports which deepened my analytical and statistical skills that is key to my Data Analyst Career.

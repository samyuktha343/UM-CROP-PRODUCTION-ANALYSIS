# UM-CROP-PRODUCTION-ANALYSIS
This project is done by me during my Data Analyst Internship at Unified Mentor

The original dataset is attached above as Crop Production data

About The Project:

I analyzed the dataset containing states and districts of India, Season, Year and Area to predict crop production and find important insights highlighting key indicators and
metrics that influence crop production.

I cleaned the data and removed the duplicates with the help of Power Query to maintain the integrity of data and used aggregation on data using Pivot Tables and bar and doughnut chart in Excel.Done the Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) with various factors of crop production to derive the insights with Excel.Implemented the overall Crop Production analysis with the Dynamic Visualization Dashboard using PowerBI.

The insights of the result shows a strong relation between Crop Production with Seasons yielding 59% of crop production in India is in  Kharif Season (June-October), Increase in Crop Production in 2011 by 10% following 2013 by 9%, Highest yield of crops in India are 92% of Coconut,4% of sugarcane and 1% of Rice and Wheat respectively and follow by other crops.


Through this project I learned about the descriptive analysis and the morre Excel,Power Query,Power BI features and usage of the dynamic dashboards for interactive reports which deepened my analytical,presentation and statistical skills that is key to my Data Analyst Career.
